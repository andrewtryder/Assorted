Supybot-Assorted
================

Supybot plugin for assorted and random things.

I put random commands that aren't big enough for plugins but are useful in here.

Many have little-to-none error checking. I'll fix if I want to. If you want to hijack the code, have fun.

Don't consider this to be updated too often.

Currently has:
advice, automeme, b64decode, b64encode, bash, bitcoin, callook, chucknorris, debt, fml, fuckingdinner, geoip, isitdown, megamillions, mortgage, mydrunktexts, nerdman, pick,
powerball, randomfacts, winewoot, and woot
